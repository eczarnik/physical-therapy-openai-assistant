# Physical Therapy AI Assistant

## Description
Utilizing the OpenAI API, this program creates a baseline physical therapy
plan for users. This is done by asking the prospective physical therapy patient
to enter the number of weeks they plan to participate in physical therapy, the primary
area in the body where they are experiencing pain, their current physical limitations,
and their physical therapy goals. Because time is limited during a patient's first PT appointment,
the baseline plan is meant to complement the physical examination performed on the patient
by their therapist and serve as a secondary source of data when creating the patient's final
PT plan. Having more information regarding patient pain, limitations, and goals may help
improve patient outcomes and ultimately help them achieve their physical therapy goals.

In addition to creating the baseline plan, patients can also ask the AI Assistant to save their
physical therapy plan to a file for them to take to their initial appointment, and they
can also ask the AI Assistant to provide directions on one more of the exercises listed
in their plan (e.g., how to perform 'toe raises').
